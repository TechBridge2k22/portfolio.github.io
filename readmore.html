            I am from Kolkata,West Bengal. I live with my family of four members that includes me, my elder brother, father and mother. 
            I have always lived my life in phases, from being a school going  grade 9 student who was bullied for being Overweight and inattractive, to being one of the most fit and admirable student of the class in grade 12. <br> I was always recognised as one of the most intelligent student of the class, but when I got into High school, I started getting ignored by my teachers, students, as now only being a good student was not enough. I lacked communication skills and was not at all attractive, and the fact that I used to be one of the most heaviest student of the class, hence I was considered for participating in co-curricular activities. It was kind of a turning point of my life as an individual, I worked on myself for 2 years, and entering in grade 12, now I was recognised and asked to attend and represent class in different activities. Hence, I learnt that just being good in academics is not enough for a being in today's generation. People do judge based on looks, attitude, communication skills and what can be the advantage of you being in their life. <br>
            As far as my coding journey is considered, I started programming in Grade 9, as it was one of the subjects in our curriculum. The first programming language, I got introduced to was Java and not having any idea about computer, I started with writing programs in notebook. This process continued for 2 years, then the day came when I finally got to code in a laptop, which my elder brother gave to me for completing my project , as in school we only had one hour and did everything as instucted bt teacher. By the time I entered grade 12, I started enjoying programming and decided to persue it forward  though my parents wanted me to get into bank jobs. 
            In my first year of college, I got introduced to Python programming language, after learning about it's fast applications, and with the booming of data, in today's world, after lots of consideration and thinking, I decided to go ahead with Python as my main programming language and aspired to build a career in the field of Data Science/ Data Analytics/ Software development using Python. The pandemic had a positive effect on my studies, as I got a lot of time to take up online courses and understand the concepts of different types of tech stacks.
